/**
 * A task manager spawns a set of threads and manages them. Tasks can then
 * be submitted to these threads to run on. You are given no guarantees as
 * to which thread/threads the task will run on, and if you submit multiple tasks
 * as part of a single task list then it is very possible that multiple of them
 * will run concurrently.
 *
 * Each submission of a task list will give back a Counter object. You can use this
 * to either check on the status of the tasks (Counter.isComplete()), or you can use the
 * Counter.waitForCompletion() method to wait for the task list to complete. Note that this
 * is completely safe to call if you are running on a task manager thread, but if you are
 * on a different thread (ex: JavaFX thread), this can be dangerous as the task manager will
 * temporarily take over that thread until the task list completes.
