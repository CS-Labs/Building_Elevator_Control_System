/**
 * This class sits at the top of the hierarchy of objects
 * which can be registered with the world. Regardless of
 * the visual representation, these objects share several
 * things in common:
 *      1) They can be transformed into the camera's space
 *         in the event that a camera is being used
 *      2) They support movement and changing movement in
 *         the form of speed and acceleration
 *      3) They can be made static, meaning all updates to
 *         their location are directly related to screen space
 *         rather than camera space (i.e., they will not be
 *         pushed off the screen because the camera moved
 *         away from them)
